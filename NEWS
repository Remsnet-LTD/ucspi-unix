-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.31 (brown paper bag release)

- Fixed bug in reading the UID/GID values from the environment.

- Fixed exit bug that caused the socket to be deleted after the first
  use.

- Fixed uninitialized variable bug in getting socket options.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.30

- Now supports UID/GID switching, setting the backlog, and printing out
  a banner on connection in tcpserver.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.20

- The environment is now set up properly according to the UCSPI
  specification, and documented in the PROTOCOL file.

- Added code to determine the socket peer credentials (UID, GID, and
  PID) on systems supporting SO_PEERCRED (specifically Linux).

Question: Should the protocol be called "UNIX" as it currently is, or
"local" which more accurately reflects that they are local-domain
sockets?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.10

- First release, includes base functionality for unixserver and
  unixclient.
